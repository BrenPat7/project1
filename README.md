# CS 210 Project 1 Read Me 

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in this project. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The ISOS suggests as a standard that any website which includes a 12-hour or a 24-hour clock gives a user the ability to change the clock to the other format. The company which I was hypothetically interviewing for had presented this as a prompt and asked me to create code that can change the formats of the clock between each. 

What did you do particularly well?
All mathematical equations and all possible outcomes are solved. If the user puts an incorrect value of time it will not allow an answer.
Additionally. The code is commented on so any other user who has to interpret the code can do so easily. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe in a scenario of this being a website application, the user having to input the time themselves is a bit archaic. The user shouldn't have to enter this information it should be assessed via the internet through the code itself. Additionally, I think there are ways to make the code more readable where I had my line separations and tabs. A small difference in how you formatted the code can help greatly when trying to comb through each section when attempting to identify an issue or where it can be made more efficient. 
C++ is used widely after so many years because of how ground floor each application has to be, this allows certain efficiencies to be made where other code may have their standard function that doesn't exactly suit every application use of it. This meaning getting to create each function with the application's end goal may take longer but it will allow for functions that run with the sole purpose of meeting the Minimum Via Product a lot sooner than what is intended for the code. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Key parts that I struggled with included identifying which equations would be needed to get the correct answer. I got through this by writing the other pieces of code and getting an overall idea of how it would function. Knowing where each value would be used helped me get an idea of what answers I was attempting to get. Additionally, the locations of each function have put some integrated into the .h file and some had to be with the main.cpp and some had to be within the clock.cpp. This was something I also kind of worked there as I wrote more parts of code. Writing non-linearly helped me jump around and add more pieces where needed. On top of this, it was tempting to write everything in one file, but there are several reasons why we have several files that hold certain pieces, for me the main reason was accessibility and readability. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
Utilizing certain mathematical theories, as well as user-inputted data being translated into different types of data.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using the methods provided in the book, as well as through some youtube videos identifying good coding habits. It is easy to write code, but it is not easy to write code that everyone can understand. When you can present the assignment and explain each function to someone who is not of coding background you have accomplished this task well. I showcased this for my code by ensuring my wife could interpret each part of the code without my help. Applications are conceptualized and often based on natural systems. There are methods of utilizing and creating analogies of real-world systems in the programming world. This is to make processes as efficient and intuitive as possible.
